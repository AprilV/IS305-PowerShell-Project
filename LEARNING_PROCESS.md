# PowerShell Learning Process
**How We Teach and Learn - The System**

---

## The Daily Process (Every Session)

### 1. TEACH ONE CONCEPT (5-10 minutes)
- I explain ONE thing in plain English
- I show a simple example (3-5 lines of code)
- I explain what each line does
- You read it, understand it

### 2. YOU PRACTICE IT (10-15 minutes)
- You type the code yourself (don't copy-paste)
- You run it
- You see what happens
- You change something and run it again

### 3. WE VERIFY IT WORKS (5 minutes)
- You show me the output
- I confirm it's correct
- We fix any problems

### 4. MOVE TO NEXT CONCEPT
- Only after you understand the current one
- Each concept builds on the last one

### 5. APPLY TO REAL PROJECT (End of week)
- After learning 4-5 concepts
- We use them in Generate-ProjectReport.ps1
- That's when you write actual project code

## The Files We Use

**PowerShell-Lesson1.ps1** (or Lesson2, Lesson3, etc.)
- Where I teach you concepts
- You practice here
- Small examples only

**Generate-ProjectReport.ps1**
- The actual project code
- We write real code here at end of each week
- This is what gets graded

---

## The Teaching Style

**What I DO:**
- Teach one small thing at a time
- Use plain English
- Show simple examples
- Explain where variables come from
- Let you practice before moving on

**What I DON'T DO:**
- Dump complete solutions
- Use technical jargon
- Skip ahead to advanced stuff
- Assume you know things
- Change the process randomly

## Daily Session Structure

**Start of Session:**
1. Read this file to remember the process
2. Open yesterday's lesson file
3. Quick review: "What did we learn last time?"

**During Session:**
4. I teach today's concept (Lesson file)
5. You practice (hands-on, not watching me)
6. We test and verify
7. You understand it before we stop

**End of Session:**
8. Save the lesson file with today's date
9. Make notes about what you learned
10. Identify what's next for tomorrow

## If Things Go Wrong

**If you don't understand something:**
- STOP immediately
- Tell me what's confusing
- I explain it differently (simpler)
- We don't move forward until you get it

**If I go too fast:**
- STOP me
- Remind me: "One thing at a time"
- Point to this document

**If I create random files or change the process:**
- STOP me
- Point to this document
- Say "Follow the process"

## This Is The System

Read this file at the start of every session.
Follow the process.
Don't deviate.
Consistency over speed.
